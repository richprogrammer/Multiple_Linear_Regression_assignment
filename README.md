# Foundations of Machine Learning Models

## Assignment: Multiple Linear Regression

#### Name: Richard Lee

### Details
The purpose of this assignment is to hone your matplotlib skills, and expose you to an elementary multiple linear regression problem. 

The provided data has been generated from a simple linear model, but some random noise has been added. Your goal is to perform multivariate ordinary least squares linear regression to determine the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE) for the model (that is, you must calculate the model parameters for a linear regression model).  There will be some irreducible error due to the noise that was injected into the data, therefore we will never be able to exactly recover the "true model parameters".  However, the optimal model parameters computed via the linear regression analysis are sufficiently accurate that you will be able to infer the true model parameters for yourslef!

Here are the steps you will take:

1. Create the following figure using matplotlib, which plots the data from the file called `MultipleLinearRegressionData.csv`.
2. Perform linear regression to calculate the optimal ordinary least squares regression model parameters.
3. Recreate the first figure by adding the best fit curve to all subplots.
4. Infer the true model parameters.
